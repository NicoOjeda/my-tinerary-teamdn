      " Wat Pho is one of the top six temples in Thailand and is famous for the huge statue of the Reclining Buddha. By huge, we mean so big it looks like the temple was built around it because there‚Äôs really no way it could have been squeezed through the door. Besides the gigantic Reclining Buddha, the temple is well known for the numerous Buddha images all around it. In addition, the temple was the first center in Thailand for public education, offering science, religion and literature courses. It is located very close to the Grand Palace and the Temple of the Emerald Buddha. Thus, Wat Pho does not get as many tourists as other temples which makes it less crowded, perfect for new tourists in Thailand.",
